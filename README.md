# hello-world
This is my initial Github repository - for storing collected information from the web that might help me learn to code.

Sooo many resources out there to fish thruogh...  where to start?
Perhaps:
- Play with https://scratch.mit.edu/
- Sign-in to Git-Hub https://github.com/login (UserName DalFraz)
- Try using https://glitch.com/signin
- Also tiral https://codepen.io/ (do I want to be a front-end or back-end dev?)
- Start some coding tutorials like https://www.freecodecamp.org/
- Or perhaps https://www.codecademy.com/ (or both?)
- Then... start to systematically go theorugh the resources at https://welearncode.com/favorite-free-resources/
